# Longevity World Cup Game Nights

We play games on video calls. Game nights are open to all obsessed longevity athletes.

## Why?

There seems to be demand from longevity athletes to get to know each other.

## How?

- When? Every Monday 17:00 UTC
- Where? https://riverside.fm/studio/lwc-game-nights
- Games are sometimes recorded and published.
- Camera and microphone are required, otherwise it won't be fun.

## What?

What follows is an unorganized brainstorming of games we can play: **zero props, zero software, video‑call‑friendly.**
