# Ruleset
The Longevity World Cup is a competition between longevity athletes. The goal is to improve the results of biological aging clocks.

## Schedule
- Every year a different competition starts where a different biological aging clock is used for the competition. We call this a **Season**. This is to keep things fresh and exciting, while also keeping up with research on biological aging measurements. In 2025, this aging clock is [PhenoAge](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5940111/pdf/aging-10-101414.pdf), which can be derived from certain blood biomarkers.
- Each season starts and ends in around the middle of January, however test results are valid only from the given calendar year: from January 1st to December 31st.

## Point System
- In LWC2025, what counts is the highest biological age reversal: the larger the difference between your biological and chronological age, the higher you rank.
- You can submit as many tests as you want, for your ranking, always the lowest one counts. If cost is a concern, you can choose to submit just one test during the year at the best possible time, allowing you to participate without significant financial burden. However, if you're addicted to getting your blood drawn, you can theoretically also be submitting a test result every single day of the year.
- In LWC2025 various leagues are also in effect. You might be doing average in the ultimate league and you could still be winning the league of your generation.

## Prizes and Payouts
- In LWC2025 prize money is given to the top 3 athletes in the ultimate league.
- The prize money pool is coming from Bitcoin donations and you are encouraged to contribute.
- 10% of the donations go toward covering organizational troubles, while 90% fund the prize money pool.
- Payouts happen in the middle of January in Bitcoin. We'll help you set up a Bitcoin wallet if you don't already have one. We generally recommend [Green Wallet](https://blockstream.com/green/) for Mobile or [Wasabi Wallet](https://wasabiwallet.io/) for desktop. Funfact: Wasabi Wallet was created by the same developer who created the Longevity World Cup.

## FAQ
### What is PhenoAge?
[PhenoAge](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5940111/pdf/aging-10-101414.pdf) is a biological age measure based on clinical biomarkers like glucose and CRP. It reflects physiological aging, not just years lived, and helps assess health and disease risk.

### From which biomarkers can I calculate my PhenoAge?
- Albumin (also known as Serum Albumin)
- Creatinine (sometimes called Serum Creatinine)
- Glucose (also referred to as Blood Sugar)
- C-Reactive Protein (CRP, also known as hs-CRP for high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein)
- Lymphocyte Percentage (may be labeled as Lymphocyte % or Absolute Lymphocyte Count)
- Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV, also called Average Red Blood Cell Size)
- Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW, sometimes called RDW-CV or Red Blood Cell Size Variation)
- Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP, also referred to as Alk Phos)
- White Blood Cell Count (WBC Count, also called Leukocyte Count)

### Why did you choose PhenoAge for 2025 World Cup?
[PhenoAge](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5940111/pdf/aging-10-101414.pdf) can be acquired from traditional blood biomarkers. To kick off the very first Longevity World Cup, creating a low barrier of entry is paramount.

### What if my results arrive late?
Each season is wrapped up in the middle of January. This should give your laboratory enough time to evaluate your test conducted on December 31.

### What if there's a tie?
While a tie in age reversal is unlikely, the next deciding criteria is your biological age. The older you are, the higher you rank in case of a tie. If you end up being born on the same day as the person you tied with in your age-reversal test, then  we resort to alphabetical ordering of usernames. Needless to say, this should never happen.

### What will sponsorships entail?
Sponsorships are a feature that is planned to come later. Companies will be able to sponsor athletes with bitcoins in exchange for visibility on the website.

### How much can I edit my profile picture?
Your profile picture must be you, facing the camera. However you are free to edit it. You could even submit a drawing or an AI generated drawing. Just make sure it is still you!

### I am an athlete already, how can I make changes?
Any change requests are handled by you sending us an email to `longevityworldcup@gmail.com`.

### Can I cheat?
No, you can't. 

### How does the Longevity World Cup compare to the Rejuvenationy Olympics?
While the Longevity World Cup (LWC) was originally inspired by the Rejuvenation Olympics (RO), the differences between them are numerous and growing over time:
- **Focus**: LWC emphasizes **absolute age reversal**, whereas RO prioritizes measuring the **pace of aging**.
- **Structure**: LWC introduces **annual seasons** with a rotating focus on a single clock.
- **Prizes**: LWC offers **prize money**, funded through Bitcoin donations, providing direct financial incentives for participants.
- **Leagues**: LWC includes **leagues**, allowing participants to compete within their generation or other categories.
- **Testing**: LWC2025 uses **traditional blood-test-based biological age calculations**, while RO relies on the **TruDiagnostic home test kit**.
