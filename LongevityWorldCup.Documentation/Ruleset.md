# Ruleset
The Longevity World Cup is a competition between longevity athletes. The goal is to improve the results of biological aging clocks.

## Schedule
- Every year a different competition starts where a different biological aging clock is used for the competition. We call this a **Season**. This is to keep things fresh and exciting, while also keeping up with research on biological aging measurements. In 2025, this aging clock is [PhenoAge](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5940111/pdf/aging-10-101414.pdf), which can be derived from certain blood biomarkers.
- Each season starts and ends in around the middle of January, however test results are valid only from the given calendar year: from January 1st to December 31st.

- In LWC2025, what counts is the highest biological age reversal: the larger the difference between your biological and chronological age, the higher you rank.
- You can submit as many tests as you want, for your ranking, always the lowest one counts. If cost is a concern, you can choose to submit just one test during the year at the best possible time, allowing you to participate without significant financial burden. However, if you're addicted to getting your blood drawn, you can theoretically also be submitting a test result every single day of the year.
- In LWC2025 various leagues are also in effect. You might be doing average in the ultimate league and you could still be winning the league of your generation.

## Prizes and Payouts
- In LWC2025 prize money is given to the top 3 athletes in the ultimate league.
- The prize money pool is coming from Bitcoin donations and you are encouraged to contribute.
- 10% of the donations go toward covering organizational troubles, while 90% fund the prize money pool.
- Payouts happen in the middle of January in Bitcoin. We'll help you set up a Bitcoin wallet if you don't already have one. We generally recommend [Green Wallet](https://blockstream.com/green/) for Mobile or [Wasabi Wallet](https://wasabiwallet.io/) for desktop. Funfact: Wasabi Wallet was created by the same developer who created the Longevity World Cup.

### About PhenoAge and Testing
#### What is PhenoAge?

[PhenoAge](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5940111/pdf/aging-10-101414.pdf) is a biological age measure based on clinical biomarkers like glucose and CRP. It reflects physiological aging, not just years lived, and helps assess health and disease risk.

#### From which biomarkers can I calculate my PhenoAge?
- Albumin (Serum Albumin)  
- Creatinine (Serum Creatinine)  
- Glucose (Blood Sugar)  
- C-Reactive Protein (CRP or hs-CRP)  
- Lymphocyte Percentage (Lymphocyte % or Absolute Lymphocyte Count)  
- Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV or Average Red Blood Cell Size)  
- Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW, RDW-CV)  
- Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP, Alk Phos)  
- White Blood Cell Count (WBC Count, Leukocyte Count)  

#### Why did you choose PhenoAge for 2025 World Cup?
[PhenoAge](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5940111/pdf/aging-10-101414.pdf) can be acquired from traditional blood biomarkers. To kick off the very first Longevity World Cup, creating a low barrier of entry is paramount.

#### Can I use any laboratory for my tests in LWC2025?
Yes, as long as the lab provides accurate blood biomarkers required for PhenoAge calculation.

### Competition Mechanics
#### What happens if my results arrive late?
Each season is wrapped up in the middle of January. This should give your laboratory enough time to evaluate your test conducted on December 31.

#### What if there's a tie?

The older you are, the higher you rank in case of a tie. If necessary, alphabetical ordering of usernames will decide.  

#### How can I cheat?
You can't. 

#### How does the Longevity World Cup compare to the Rejuvenationy Olympics?
- **Focus**: LWC emphasizes **absolute age reversal**, while RO currently measures the **pace of aging** regardless of chronological age.  
- **Structure**: LWC has **annual seasons** with a single-clock focus.  
- **Prizes**: LWC offers **prize money** through Bitcoin donations.  
- **Leagues**: LWC includes **leagues** for generational and other category-based rankings.  
- **Testing**: LWC2025 uses traditional blood-test-based biological age calculations; RO uses the TruDiagnostic home test kit.

### Practical Matters
#### How much can I edit my profile picture?
Your profile picture must be you, facing the camera, but you can edit it freely, even as a drawing or AI-generated version.

#### I am an athlete already, how can I make changes?
Any change requests are handled by sending us an email to `longevityworldcup@gmail.com`.

#### What will sponsorships entail?
Sponsorships are planned for future seasons, allowing companies to sponsor athletes in exchange for visibility on the website.

#### What happens if Bitcoin's value fluctuates significantly?
[1 BTC = 1 BTC](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/w1di0k/please_understand_what_1_btc_1_btc_really_means/)
